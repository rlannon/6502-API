flag,name,description
N,"Negative","Set when the result of the last instruction was negative (>= $80)"
Z,"Zero","Set when the result of the last instruction was 0. Also used to check equality (result is equal when Z = 1)"
V,"Overflow","Set when the result of a signed mathematical operation does not fit into 8 bits (i.e. result is outside the range -128 to 127). Also set by the BIT instruction based on the value at the tested address"
B,"Break","Set when an interrupt is triggered by the BRK instruction; this can help determine whether an interrupt was triggered by hardware (B is 0) or software (B is 1); note that it only affects the pushed value, and this bit is ignored on the PLP instruction"
D,"Decimal","Indicates whether the CPU is operating using binary-coded-decimal"
I,"Interrupt disable","When set, disables maskable interrupts (IRQs). This is automatically set when an interrupt occurs, and can be manually set and cleared with the SEI and CLI instructions, respectively"
C,"Carry","Indicates whether the result of a mathematical operation was outside the range 0 to 255, enabling 16-bit arithmetic. This flag is also set by comparisons when the right-hand value is greater than or equal to the left-hand value"
