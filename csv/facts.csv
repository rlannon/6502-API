"The 6502 was first released in 1975"
"When released, the 6502 was the least expensive processor on the market"
"The processor is considered responsible for the home computer revolution of the 1980s"
"A modified form of the 6502 was used in the NES, Apple II, and BBC Micro"
"The 6502 is still widely used today -- hundreds of millions are still being produced for use in embedded systems"
"The processor's max clock rate ranges from 1MHz to 3MHz, about 1,000 times slower than many of the processors in modern laptops"
"Compared to other processors of the time, the 6502 has very few registers -- a measely 3 general-purpose registers compared with the Z80's 8"
"The original design included 3,218 transistors. By comparison, an Intel i7 processor can have upwards of 2 billion"
"The 6502 has an 8-bit data size, meaning its registers can handle values in the range 0-255"
"The 6502 has a 16-bit address bus, allowing it to address 65,536 bytes (64k) of data"
"You can still purchase 6502 CPUs from Western Design Center -- they cost about $6 USD apiece"
